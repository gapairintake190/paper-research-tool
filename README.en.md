```bash
# Check AI configuration
python paper_tool_pro.py config

# Look up a paper (no AI needed)
python paper_tool_pro.py alphaxiv 2401.12345

# Literature review
python paper_tool_pro.py synthesize --papers paper1.txt paper2.txt --topic "machine learning in education"

# Critical analysis
python paper_tool_pro.py analyze --papers paper1.txt --framework strengths-weaknesses

# Research gap detection
python paper_tool_pro.py gaps --papers paper1.txt paper2.txt --domain "NLP"

# Research narrative (with topic → full analysis + Chapter 1 skeleton)
python paper_tool_pro.py narrative --papers paper1.txt paper2.txt --my-topic "transformers for low-resource languages"

# Research narrative (no topic → 3 research angle suggestions)
